#+TITLE: README

* Overview

This package provides additional Java programming language support for [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]].
- Few convenience functions are available for common operations such as creating a new project or class.
- There are couple of customization options , including passing custom JVM arguments to the Eclipse JDT language server.
- The [[https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls][Eclipse JDT Language Server]] is automatically installed (if needed) when you open a Java file: this gives you code completion, refactoring capabilities, etc.

* Dependencies

- The only *direct* Emacs package dependency is [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]], assuming you're running a recent Emacs version.
- The [[https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.jdt.ls/downloads][Eclipse JDT Language server]] along with the [[https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.platform/junit-platform-console-standalone][JUnit console runner]] are configured to be *automatically installed* when not found at default locations (see =M-x customize-group= /eglot-java/).
  - The Eclipse JDT.LS team mentions that there's support for [[https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls#features][compiling projects from Java 1.5 through 16]], but you're encouraged to use recent versions of the Java Development Toolkit ([[https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/][JDK]]).
  - This extension has been tested with recent Java and Eclipse JDT snapshot versions for few years (since roughly mid-2018).
- Please also configure your *[[https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html][PATH]]* environment variable [[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/maven/maven_environment_setup.htm][for Maven]] and/or [[https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html][for Gradle]].

* Installation

The =eglot-java= package is available on [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][MELPA]].

Once the MELPA repository is configured, please run =M-x package-install= and type =eglot-java=.

* Usage

** Customization

You can configure few settings to reflect your preferences via =M-x customize-group= (/eglot-java/):
- You can set the default LSP server installation folder, etc.
- You can specify JVM arguments for the LSP server (=eglot-java-eclipse-jdt-args= variable).
- The default =java-mode= keybindings are controlled by the custom variable =eglot-java-default-bindings-enabled=.
- The default prefix key for available functions is defined by the variable =eglot-java-prefix-key= (=C-c l=).
- etc.

** Configuration

Please find below a simple initialization of this package.

#+begin_src elisp
(eval-after-load 'eglot-java
  (progn
    (require 'eglot-java)
    '(eglot-java-init)))
#+end_src

* Contributing

All the bugs report are welcome and appreciated.
- *Please note that the best way to contribute is via pull requests*.
- I may not notice immediately when something is broken: I don't write that much code nowadays (proof of concepts, side-projects or "occasional work related things", specific or one-off tooling).
