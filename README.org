#+TITLE: README

* Overview
This project is a set of functions for Java programming inside [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], using a Java LSP server such as the [[https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls][Eclipse JDT Language Server]].
The implementation leverages [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]] (and the built-in [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/progmodes/project.el][project.el]] library for project management).

* Dependencies
- The only Emacs package dependency is [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]], with the assumption that you're running a recent enough version of Emacs.
- You also need to download a recent version of the [[https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.jdt.ls/downloads][Eclipse JDT Language server]] (along with a recent JDK installed and JAVA_HOME defined).
- For running tests, please grab the latest jar for [[https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.platform/junit-platform-console-standalone][Junit Platform Console Standalone runner]] and place it at the location of your choice.
- If using Maven as build tool, it's assumed that it's main executable is added to your [[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/maven/maven_environment_setup.htm][PATH environment variable]].
- If using Gradle as build tool, it's assumed that it's main executable is added to your [[https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html][PATH environment variable]].

* Installation

Copy the contents of /eglot-java.el/ to a new Emacs buffer and run the command =M-x package-install-from-buffer=.

* Usage

** Customization

You need to customize few settings to reflect your environment via =M-x customize-group= (/eglot-java/): LSP server installation folder, etc.
- The default =java-mode= keybindings are controlled by the custom variable =eglot-java-default-bindings-enabled= and the prefix key variable =eglot-java-prefix-key= (=C-c l=). 
- You can inspect all the pre-defined keybindings applied to the =java-mode= by typing =C-c l C-h=, after opening a Java file.

** Configuration

Please find below a simple initialization of this package.
#+begin_src elisp
